# XMLWebTest
Added tests using JUnit.
Here I have the following:
- test for the authentication filter that catches the login info of user. I check the correct redirection to the page
- test for the DOM and SAX parsers so they do it correctly
- test for the database in case I send an empty object of developer to update
- test for the starting servlet to redirect correctly

All tests are passed successfully
